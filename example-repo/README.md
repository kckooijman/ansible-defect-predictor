# Jumbo - A local Hadoop cluster bootstrapper

Jumbo is a tool that allows you to deploy a **virtualized Hadoop cluster** on a local machine in minutes. It is made to help you **quickly bootstrap development environments** without struggling with nodes and services configurations.

Jumbo is written in Python and relies on other tools that it coordinates:

- [Vagrant](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant), to manage the virtual machines;
- [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), to configure the cluster;
- [Apache Ambari](https://ambari.apache.org/), to provision and manage the Hadoop cluster.

The distribution used for the Hadoop cluster is [Hortonworks Data Platform](https://hortonworks.com/products/data-platforms/hdp/).

## Who can use Jumbo?

Originally, Jumbo is designed for developers with a limited knowledge of the Hadoop deployment process. But this doesn't mean that it cannot be helpful to others! Everything needed to create and deploy a Hadoop cluster is done by Jumbo, so if you need different environments (e.g. for different projects, testing...), be sure it will be useful to you!

## Getting started

A complete documentation is available at [Jumbo website](http://jumbo.adaltas.com).
Jumbo installation instructions are available on the [installation page](http://jumbo.adaltas.com/getting-started/installation).

If you want a local documentation, it is also available in [Gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) format in the `docs/` folder.
