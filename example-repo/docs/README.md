# Jumbo documentation

This Gitbook contains the documentation of Jumbo - a tool allowing to deploy local virtualized Hadoop clusters in minutes. You will find a [getting started guide](getting-started/) as well as a detailed description of every command of the [Jumbo CLI](commands) and a complete [listing of services supported](supported.md) by Jumbo.

The versions of Jumbo and of the other project that it relies on (Vagrant, Ansible, etc.) are available [here](versions.md).
